I forked Dan Marshall's project, just because there is no guarentee it'll be there next year.  And I used his project to make character shapes for my project.  If I need to make new character shapes, or change the ones I have, I want this tool to be available. 
(gathering repositories that I need for Abe, under the prefix "Abe_")
